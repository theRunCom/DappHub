## Definition of DAPP

A dapp runs its backend code on a decentralized peer-to-peer network. In contrast, an app runs its backend code on centralized servers.

+ Decentralized - dapps run on the Ethereum blockchain, which is an open public decentralized platform that no single person or group controls

+ Deterministic - they execute the same function no matter what environment they are executed in

+ Turing Complete - dapps can execute any operation given enough resources

+ Isolated - they execute in a virtual environment called the EVM. Even if a smart contract fails, it won't disrupt the normal operation of the blockchain network
